# Camera Dashboard Dependencies
# 
# For Raspberry Pi, use system packages instead (recommended):
#   sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 python3-opencv python3-pyudev python3-numpy
# Then create venv with: python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
#
# For other systems, install these pinned versions:

# Core dependencies (pinned for reproducibility)
PyQt6==6.4.2
PyQt6-sip==13.4.1
numpy==1.24.2

# NOTE: The PyPI opencv-python package does NOT include GStreamer support.
# On Raspberry Pi, use the system package (python3-opencv) which includes GStreamer.
# On other systems, GStreamer will be unavailable and the app will fall back to V4L2.
# To get GStreamer support elsewhere, build OpenCV from source with -DWITH_GSTREAMER=ON.
opencv-python==4.6.0

# Testing dependencies
pytest==7.4.0

# Minimum versions (for reference if exact versions unavailable):
# PyQt6>=6.4.0
# opencv-python>=4.6.0
